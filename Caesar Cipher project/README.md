# Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption

## Project Description
This project contains a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. Users can input a message and specify a shift value to perform the encryption or decryption process. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number.

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains the Python source file `pro_cs.py` which implements the Caesar Cipher.
- `LICENSE`: The license file specifying usage permissions.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files/folders to be ignored by Git.

## Installation
This project has no external dependencies and requires only Python 3 to run.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command:
You will be prompted to enter the message and shift value. The program will then output the encrypted or decrypted text based on the selected option.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
